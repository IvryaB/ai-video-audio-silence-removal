Documentation for Audio and Video Processing Script

## Overview
This script processes a video file by detecting and removing silent segments and filler words from the associated audio track. 
It uses `moviepy`, `pydub`, and `whisper` for audio extraction, silence detection, speech transcription, and video editing. 
The output is a cleaned video with unnecessary pauses and filler words removed.

## Required Files
To ensure the script runs correctly, the following files should be present in the project directory:

- `input_video.mp4` - The video file to be processed.
- `extracted_audio.wav` - The extracted audio file (generated during execution).
- `output_video.mp4` - The final processed video (generated during execution).

Files not listed here can be considered unnecessary and removed if they are not used elsewhere.

## Dependencies
Make sure the following dependencies are installed before running the script:

- `moviepy`
- `pydub`
- `whisper`
- `ffmpeg`
- `torch`

## Functions

### detect_silences(audio_path, min_silence_len=1000, silence_thresh=-50)
Detects silent segments in an audio file.

**Parameters:**
- `audio_path` (str): Path to the audio file.
- `min_silence_len` (int): Minimum silence duration in milliseconds.
- `silence_thresh` (int): Silence threshold in decibels.

**Returns:**
- List of tuples representing silent intervals (start, end in seconds).

### transcribe_audio_with_whisper(audio_path, model_name="large", device="cuda")
Transcribes the given audio file using OpenAI's Whisper model.

**Parameters:**
- `audio_path` (str): Path to the audio file.
- `model_name` (str): Whisper model size.
- `device` (str): Computation device (`"cuda"` or `"cpu"`).

**Returns:**
- JSON object containing the transcription results.

### get_filler_word_intervals(result, filler_word_patterns)
Identifies timestamps of filler words in the Whisper transcription.

**Parameters:**
- `result` (dict): Whisper transcription output.
- `filler_word_patterns` (list): Regular expressions for filler words.

**Returns:**
- List of tuples representing filler word intervals (start, end in seconds).

### combine_intervals(silences, fillers, buffer=0.1)
Merges overlapping intervals of silences and filler words.

**Parameters:**
- `silences` (list): List of silence intervals.
- `fillers` (list): List of filler word intervals.
- `buffer` (float): Additional padding around each interval.

**Returns:**
- List of merged intervals.

### remove_intervals_from_audio_video(video_path, intervals_to_remove, output_video_path)
Removes specified intervals from a video file with smooth transitions.

**Parameters:**
- `video_path` (str): Path to the input video file.
- `intervals_to_remove` (list): Intervals to be removed.
- `output_video_path` (str): Path to save the processed video.

## Execution Steps
1. Extracts audio from the video.
2. Detects silent segments in the audio.
3. Transcribes audio using Whisper and identifies filler words.
4. Merges detected intervals.
5. Removes unwanted intervals and exports the final video.

## Usage
Ensure you have an input video file (`input_video.mp4`) and run the script. The processed video will be saved as `output_video.mp4`.

```bash
python script.py
```

## Notes
- Adjust `silence_thresh` and `min_silence_len` to fine-tune silence detection.
- Modify `filler_word_patterns` to customize filler word removal.
- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and accessible for `moviepy` and `pydub` to function correctly.
